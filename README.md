# HOG_Descriptor
For educational purposes we build a people detector as described in Navneet Dalal and Bill Triggs paper entitled <em>Histograms of Oriented Gradients for Human Detection</em>. We will be using the 160x96 pixel images found in  <a href="http://pascal.inrialpes.fr/data/human/">INRIA Person Dataset</a> to test our implementation. In addition we have provided a script to accomplish the same task using `OpenCV`. 

The method that we follow can be represented by the following diagram:

We describe the process further in the jupyter notebook. 

### OpenCV
Using the `OpenCV`:
